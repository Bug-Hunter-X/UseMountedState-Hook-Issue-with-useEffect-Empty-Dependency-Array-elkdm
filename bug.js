This error occurs when using the Expo `useMountedState` hook within a functional component that also uses the `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array. The `useMountedState` hook's value might not update correctly, leading to unexpected behavior or stale closures.  This is because the state from `useMountedState` might not be properly synchronized with the component's lifecycle.
